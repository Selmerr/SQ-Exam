# RPG Choose Your Fate SQ

To run the SQL containers detached:

# Database exam project(Choose your fate)

## Running the databases

Start the database containers in detached mode:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you need a clean MySQL reseed, recreate the Docker volumes:

All our SQL scripts are in rpg_mysql folder

MySQL seed data is available in `rpg_mysql/06_seed_data.sql`.
The Software Quality version uses one primary MySQL container on port `3307` and one secondary MySQL container on port `3308`.

The availability design is intentionally scoped:

- primary SQL is the normal active database
- secondary SQL is the failover database
- successful primary writes create application-level replication jobs
- replication is asynchronous, so eventual consistency is accepted
- the primary health monitor checks primary on a fixed interval
- emergency failover tries to drain queued replication jobs before switching to secondary
- manual failover requires the replication queue to be empty
- failback to primary is manual and should happen during a maintenance window

Availability status endpoints are exposed under:

```text
GET  /availability/status
POST /availability/failover
POST /availability/failback/begin
POST /availability/failback/complete
```

If the MySQL Docker volumes already exist, reload the schema and seed data with:


## Dump files
```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
```
## Running the backend
With the database containers running, start the Spring Boot application locally from the backend project.

## SQL scripts

All SQL scripts are located in the [rpg_mysql](C:\Users\pf\Desktop\Skole\Databases\projects\mandetory\RPG_Choose_Your_Fate\rpg_mysql) folder.

The local Docker MySQL setup runs the scripts in this order:

1. `01_create_schema.sql`
2. `02_procedures.sql`
3. `03_functions.sql`
4. `04_triggers.sql`
5. `05_seed_data.sql`
6. `06_seed_mock_data.sql`
7. `07_seed_scene_choice_expansion.sql`
8. `08_security_roles.sql`
9. `09_events.sql`
