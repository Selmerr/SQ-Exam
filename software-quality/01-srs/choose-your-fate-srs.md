# Software Requirements Specification

## Project
Choose Your Fate

## Course Context
This document is written for the Software Quality exam project. It defines the intended scope, functional requirements, and quality requirements for the current version of the system. The document is aligned with the team's current goal of delivering a vertical slice first and then extending that slice into one complete playable adventure.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
Choose Your Fate is a web-based, text-driven role-playing game inspired by classic "Choose Your Own Adventure" books. The goal is to offer players an online experience where story progression is driven by player choices. The system is intended for users who enjoy branching stories, replayability, and interactive fiction.

The system addresses two main needs:

- There are relatively few simple browser-based systems centered on classic choice-driven adventure books.
- Multiple adventures can eventually be collected in one digital platform instead of being isolated as separate books or one-off experiences.

### 1.2 Intended Audience
The primary audience for the system is:

- Players who want to play a choice-driven online text RPG.
- Administrators who manage content and maintain the available adventures.

The primary audience for this document is:

- The development group
- Reviewers
- Teachers and examiners

### 1.3 Product Scope
The current product scope is a vertical slice of a browser-based text RPG with a frontend, backend API, relational database, authentication, and a quality-focused delivery process.

The short-term project goal is:

- To implement a playable vertical slice that proves the main gameplay loop.

The next step after the vertical slice is:

- To support one complete adventure from start to finish.

Out of scope for the current slice:

- Multiple fully selectable adventures
- Large-scale content management beyond what is needed for one demonstrable adventure
- Advanced social features such as chat, guilds, multiplayer sessions, or leaderboards

### 1.4 Definitions

- **Adventure**: A complete branching story consisting of chapters, scenes, and choices.
- **Scene**: A narrative unit presented to the player.
- **Choice**: An option that moves the player to another scene and may affect progression.
- **Character**: A player-owned game entity used to progress through an adventure.
- **Vertical slice**: A small but complete end-to-end part of the system that demonstrates core functionality across frontend, backend, database, and testing.
- **Failover database**: A secondary SQL database instance intended to take over if the primary database becomes unavailable.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Product Perspective
Choose Your Fate is a client-server web application consisting of:

- A React frontend
- A Spring Boot backend exposed through an HTTP API
- A relational database for persistent storage
- An external public API integration

For the Software Quality version of the project, the primary persistence strategy is relational. MongoDB and Neo4j are excluded from this version of the system description. Instead, the system architecture is intended to include:

- One primary SQL database instance
- One mirrored or standby SQL database instance for improved availability

### 2.2 User Classes

#### Player
A player can:

- Create an account
- Log in
- Create and manage characters
- Play through scenes
- Make choices
- Potentially manage inventory, items, and quests depending on the completed slice

#### Administrator
An administrator can:

- Manage content for adventures
- Maintain scenes, choices, and related story data
- Potentially manage chapters, items, quests, and other game entities

## 3. Assumptions and Constraints

### 3.1 Assumptions

- The system is used through a web browser.
- Users have internet access.
- The backend exposes a REST-style API.
- A relational database is the authoritative source of game and account data in the Software Quality version.
- The project will include CI and automated testing as part of the delivery.

### 3.2 Constraints

- The project is developed within course time and team capacity.
- The deliverable must contain a frontend, backend, database, external API integration, testing, and CI.
- The current scope is limited to one vertical slice and then one full demonstrable adventure.
- High availability is addressed through a mirrored SQL setup rather than through multiple heterogeneous databases.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Authentication and Account Management

#### FR-1 Account Registration
The system shall allow a new player account to be created with the required credentials and profile data.

#### FR-2 Authentication
The system shall allow registered users to log in and receive authenticated access to protected functionality.

#### FR-3 Authorization
The system shall distinguish between at least two roles:

- Player

#### FR-15 Item Support
The system should support items associated with the character and/or adventure logic if this functionality is included in the implemented slice.

The system should support quest data and quest progression if this functionality is included in the implemented slice.

### 4.6 External API Integration

#### FR-17 External API Usage
The system shall integrate with at least one external public API as required by the course assignment.

#### FR-18 External API Isolation
The external API integration shall be encapsulated so that failures in the external service do not corrupt internal game data.

Note:
The current codebase appears to include text-to-speech integration. If the group keeps this as the selected external API integration, the final document can name that integration explicitly.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Availability

The database design should minimize downtime in the event of primary database failure.

### 5.2 Reliability and Data Integrity

#### NFR-4 Consistent Persistence
The system shall preserve data consistency for accounts, characters, scenes, and related game entities.

#### NFR-5 Constraint Enforcement
The relational database shall enforce key integrity rules such as primary keys, foreign keys, and relevant uniqueness constraints.

## 7. Initial User Stories

### US-1 Player Login
As a player, I want to log in so that I can access my game progress and characters.

### US-2 Create Character
As a player, I want to create a character so that I can begin an adventure.

### US-3 Continue Story
As a player, I want to view my current scene and available choices so that I can progress through the story.

### US-4 Make Choice
As a player, I want to choose between different actions so that the story changes based on my decisions.

### US-5 Admin Content Management
As an administrator, I want to manage story content so that new adventures and scenes can be added to the platform.

### US-6 Preserve Availability
As a system stakeholder, I want the database layer to tolerate primary database failure so that the system can maintain availability as well as possible within the project scope.

## 8. Acceptance-Oriented Slice Definition

The current vertical slice is considered successful if the following is demonstrated:

- A player can create an account or log in
- A player can create a character
- A player can enter at least one adventure flow
- The system can present a scene and available choices
- A selected choice moves the player to the next scene
- The backend persists relevant game state in the relational database
- The frontend, backend, database, and external API integration work together end-to-end

The next milestone after the vertical slice is a complete playable adventure with the same architectural and quality principles.

## 9. Open Decisions

The following points should be confirmed before the final PDF version is submitted:

- Which external public API is the officially selected integration
- Whether inventory, items, and quests are included in the final slice or listed as partial/optional functionality
- Whether the mirrored SQL setup is automatic failover, manual failover, or standby-only in the final implementation
- Whether the final wording should describe "adventures" as a future feature or keep the current delivery strictly focused on one adventure

## 10. Summary
Choose Your Fate is specified as a quality-focused web application for interactive text-based adventure gameplay. The current Software Quality version focuses on a relational architecture, authenticated gameplay, content administration, automated testing, CI, and improved availability through a mirrored SQL setup. The document deliberately reflects the team's current delivery target: one solid vertical slice first, then one complete adventure.
